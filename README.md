##### Simple app to check your Mac Battery health.

_healthi_ shows a small icon in your topbar with the current battery health of your mac, which is the percentage of your battery capacity compared to the original one.

- **90% - 100%**: Battery is good
- **80% - 90%**:  Battery is ok but it should be replaced soon
- **0%  - 80%**:   Battery needs to be replaced
